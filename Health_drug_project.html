            <p class="desc" style="width:500px; left:25%; background-color: black; color:white;">E-cigarettes  usually contain a battery, a heating device, and a liquid storage compartment. They can be used to deliver marijuana and other drugs. </p>

            <ul class="desc3">
                <li>Acute nicotine exposure can be toxic, and children and 
                    adults alike have been poisoned from exposure through 
                    the eyes and skin to the liquid found in e-cigarettes. </li>
                <li>Other substances found in e-cigarettes include cancer
                     causing chemicals and tiny particles in the aerosol 
                     which reach deep into the lungs during inhalation.</li>

                    <li>The long term effects of using e-cigarettes are mostly 
                        unknown, as they have not been around long enough to be
                         thoroughly studied. However, it is suspected that these 
                         long term effects may be similar to the long term effects 
                         of cigarette use, which includes cancer, lung disease, heart disease, 
                         and diabetes, among others.</li>

            <p class="desc4">Some e-cigarettes are designed to look like regular cigarettes or cigars, 
                while others may look like pens, USB-sticks, or other everyday items.</p>
