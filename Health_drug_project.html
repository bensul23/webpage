                <li>Acute nicotine exposure can be toxic, and children and 
                    adults alike have been poisoned from exposure through 
                    the eyes and skin to the liquid found in e-cigarettes. </li>

                         thoroughly studied. However, it is suspected that these 
                         long term effects may be similar to the long term effects 
                         of cigarette use, which includes cancer, lung disease, heart disease, 
                         and diabetes, among others.</li>

                <li>E-cigarettes are often used as a substitute for more extreme substances such as cigarettes,
